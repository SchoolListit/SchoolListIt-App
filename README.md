# SchooListIt (SchooL-List-It)

## Housekeeping
There are currently two branches.
- Master: live on the [demo site](https://app.schoolistit.com/)
- Welcome: working to implement ux improvements to include a proper set up of new users. If I dont get that merged into the demo, it is worth checking out what I have planned. 

# SchoolListIt
## What's due and when for any school, anywhere
### No matter how you school

Since Covid-19, many parents are facing a new and difficult balance of working from home and also schooling from home with fewer childcare options available. A particularly tough, nearly impossible circumstance for single parent homes, the only choice is to reach out farther into the community for support. However, most school information systems do not allow access to extended family and friends - even those that do have a 'big system' user experience that is unfamiliar and confusing to untrained users. 

Meanwhile teachers all across the United States are scrambling to teach in multiple formats with very little time to prepare because of shifting plans and uncertainty. Many schools are still undecided.  

## SchoolListIt is a bulletin board in the town square
### Where anyone can share and everyone can benefit
SchoolListit is the application that pulls it all together in one consistent format no matter how school looks for your family. Think of SchoolListIt as a bulletin board in the town square dedicated to what each class needs to get done each week. 

Any homeschool, public school, private school, or even a karate studio can post the "deliverables" for students. Parents, grandparents, and family friends can help students stay on track. 

- SchoolListIt can push-pull data from any existing system's REST API
- Parents can use SchoolListIt to help each other out
- Even if the api cannot pull data it can quickly be entered and shared
- A tool for creating lessons is included for teachers (video, images, headlines, text, links)
- Assignments can link to another app or within SchoolListIt to a lesson

**It sounds really simple, and maybe that is what makes SchoolListIt special.** SchoolListIt is simple by design. Busy parents only have a few short minutes. In that short amount of time, SchoolListIt is designed to serve exactly the right information and nothing else, programmatically. 

## Usage

### Installation
SchoolListIt is a web application and installs automatically from the web browser onto a your phone (or computer) on the first visit. From there, it can work offline and sync when your connection restores. 

### Set Up
The first time, you are promted to
- designate first language
- choose a role (student, teacher, parent, other helper)
- outline your challenges (time shortage, disabilities, any reading problems, technology)
- identify your students by name, grade
- select your schools

Set up and installation takes around 30s for an average user. There are no limitations, anyone can join and use SchoolListIt. If your school doesn't show up, just type your schools' name to create it. 

### Following Classes
The first time you open the app, your class feed will show every class from your schools and you need to "follow" the right classes for your students. By following a class, you assign it to one of your students or yourself. If you don't see the classes you need, you can enter them by creating an assignment.

**And that's it**. SchoolListIt creates a scheduled checklist of what you need to complete for you and each child in your profile. You can follow classes for yourself, each individual student, or your 'household' view. 

### Class Feed
Your class feed shows every class you follow for every student and  yourself - just 'scroll' through and check what isn't done for today and check off what you have done.

### Sharing
If you add the assignments your teacher sent home, you can share SchoolListIt to Facebook, Pinterest, or Twitter so other families dont need to enter and can keep track. If you were ever a room mom before Covid-19 shut down schools, this is a great way to still help out in the "classroom". Kind of like Facebook groups, a SchoolListIt class is a way for all the members to get together and help each other out. 

### Comment
Comment on any assignment. This is a great way to get help from a friend or another parent if you're stuck or confused about an assignment. Comments are public like a tweet - it goes out to anyone following that assignment in a class - and thier comments will show up to you. That is really helpful because someone else may have the same question.

### What's Public and What's Secure
SchoolListIt is built with your child's security in mind. The names of your children, and which classes you follow for them is only available to you. 

Everything else on SchoolListIt is public. If you don't want it shared, don't post it. It you don't want it repeated, don't put it in a comment on SchoolListit.

SchoolListIt has no access to grades or testing or test scores.
