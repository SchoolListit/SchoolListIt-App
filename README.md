## Public Education Should Be Public

Teachers in Iowa, North Carolina, and Mumbai are all creating learning content lessons on much of the same material. A central repository where teachers can clone and fork learning material  could revolutionize the way we think about education. 

### Closing the education gap

Parental oversight is a known factor to the success of any student, and on the flip side a factor contributing to the the education gap. However, overseeing your children's education in our current system has an opportunity cost far too high for most working mothers and fathers. It is very difficult to gain access to schoolwork and homework deliverables and far more difficult to gain access to the learning material itself. The system is not designed to facilitate the parental oversight proven to work. SchooListIt is designed to do exactly that!

### Learning is more than just acess to lessons. 
Pacing for elementary students is key. Learning materials, Lesson Plans and clear deliverables are all part of that pacing.  SchooListIt goes beyond the lesson and tackles the lesson plan, deliverables, and learning materials with and open source ethos giving parents real time, instant, and easy access via a smart phone in a social feed format. 

SchooListIt can meet parents where they are and really equip them to oversee and co-educate with teachers.

## Public education should be public
The concept of Open Source in the software world is producing the fruit predicted by thought leaders such as Larry Ellison who famously said, “Once open source gets good enough, competing with it would be insane.” 

Covid-19 is disruptive to the public education system and will make a lasting mark on primary education. Let's make lemonade out of the lemons thrown our way by Covid-19 and Open Source our public education. Teachers can learn the open source workflow and thought process: create - package - share - clone - iterate - fork. 

Just one year of US public school teachers contributing learning materials, lesson plans, assignments, and assignment schedules into a central storehouse (or integrated storehouses) would build a digital open source - open education library deep enough to educate the world's children for generations to come.

- Once created and shared the iteration needed annually for each teacher becomes miniscule. 
- Creating and monitoring individual learning plans for our students becomes a possibility where it never has been before. 
- Data Science can be used to identify opportunities for early intervention with at risk students and intervene in a non-intrusive non-offensive way
- Learning materials can be optimized using data science to identify which are most effective and pair student learning style with student on a granular level
- Open source learning materials could reallocate a huge tax budget directly to teachers (in NC alone, 12M is budgeted for the 2020-201 school year to spend on mostly closed source copyrighted learning resources).

## Decoupling secure from public data
SchooListIt aims to decouple the secure student identifiable data from the pulic learning resource data in a system designed to facilitate parental oversight creating a revolutionary opportunity for parent-teacher cooperation. 

__What if our teachers could focus on the Students rather than content creation?__

1) Avoid Reinventing the Wheel - Use of powerful pre-existing platforms
2) Communication Consolidation - Log in using your platform of choice: Facebook, Google, Pinterest
3) Meet People Where they Are - On their channels with the tools they like to use
4) Grow Virally from the Bottom Up - Easy Teacher and Parent Sharing of Lessons
5) Device Diversity - Works on Phones, Tablets, Ipad, Iphones, Androids, Roku, Fire, etc.
6) Notification Effectiveness - Parents Teachers Students and Administration able to contacted numerous ways - phone, text, email, msging,
7) Security - Utilizes the most advanced security methods already in use with the largest companies
8) Inclusive/Exclusive - Can be used by just parents, or parents and teachers
9) Open Source Shareable Lesson Plans - Teachers can access other teachers lesson collateral and adapt to their own classes
